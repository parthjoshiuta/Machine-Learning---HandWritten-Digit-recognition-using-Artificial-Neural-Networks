# Machine-Learning-HandWritten-Digit-recognition-using-Artificial-Neural-Networks

<b>Problem Statement :</b> Implement MNIST Handwritten digits dataset recognition using Artificial Neural Networks<br>
<b>Language Used :</b> Python<br>
<b>External Libraries Used :</b> MatplotLib, Pandas, Math<br>
<b>No Of Hidden Layer :</b> 1<br>
<b>No Of Input Units :</b> 785<br>
<b>No Of Hidden Units :</b> 100<br>
<b>No Of Output Units :</b> 10<br>
<b>Dataset :</b> MNIST (Imported from .csv files)<br>

## Instructions to Run :

<p>The program does not require you to do anything. Once the files are extracted,
you will need to import all the external libraries in the interpreter.
Once the libraries are successfully imported, you can directly run the program in
order to see the results.</p>

## Comments :

<p>I was facing some difficulty while importing the data from sklearn. So I spent
some time in finding a csv file which I have used from for importing the data. So
you will need to import pandas while running the program in order to upload the
data.</p>
<p>The program is currently running at a learning rate of 0.1 and due to less
resources in my laptop, I have reduced the number of iterations to 10. I did test it
with more iterations as well, but I found that the performance was almost the
same.</p>
<p>After running the code multiple times, the program has achieved an accuracy of
approximately 95% to 96%.</p>
<p>It is possible to run the code on the configuration you need by just altering the
learning rate and the number of epochs required.
On comparing with the performance with respect to the logistic regression, it can
be seen that we are able to get much better results using ANN.
